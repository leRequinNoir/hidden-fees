# Compare hidden fees
This application downloads exchange rates of 10 Eastern European banks and compares their hidden fees on currency exchange. Mid-market exchange rates are downloaded from a TransferWise website. The user can choose a route and an amount for the currency exchange.

The application is written in Python and it is wrapped in a Jupyter Notebook which provides an interactive user interface.

To run the application, please use the following link:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/leRequinNoir/hidden-fees.git/master?filepath=compare.ipynb

The Jupyter Notebook will take a few minutes to load, so please be patient. When it is ready, please click on a button *Run*. The application will now download current exchange rates. This will take some time. After it finishes, please scroll down and you will see a user interface of the application on the bottom of the page.

The application currently works with 6 Czech, 3 Slovak and 1 Hungarian banks, but it can be relatively easily extended to include at least 20 banks from the region.
